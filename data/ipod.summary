 Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones stereo etc)  
 BATTERY Compared to the other players on the market the iPod has one of the worst batteries around
  The major change from the previous model other than the extra 5G for the same price is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter and the already minimal buttons (menu play/pause forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10000 stolen mp3s 
But seriously though how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen
  This may be the player for you but its not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player and others are ahead of it in certain areas so practice some caution when you buy     
  As far as an actual player is concerned the iPod is next to none
 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time per charge
