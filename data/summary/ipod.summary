 Doesnt have alot of good games on it
My friend has this unit while not experience it much I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy and its definitely the most overrated gadget in history 
However he quickly helped me and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now 
 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them ) They just didnt know about the ARCHOS gmini400 
  Comments Overall this is still a great value but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market
No inbox accessories-- An arm strap belt strap case or anything would be nice but nope Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th with moveable parts its easy to damage an iPod at a gym so this is for more casual listeners note the iPod Mini doesnt have moveable parts and is made of titanium
  The weight is heavier than many digital players but I like the solid feel 
 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last but I kind of doubt it  
The sound is INCREDIBLE very clean very wide dynamic range of bass mids and highs and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast
I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs get a larger size such as the 40GB just to be on the safe side

Like I said Ive had my ipod for six short months and Id estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most
However in my mind $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS 
  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model which is way too big for what I really need I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity 
 BATTERY Compared to the other players on the market the iPod has one of the worst batteries around
In the meantime users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer its impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which were not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours  
This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection  
 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads 
 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster  
All in all this is a wonderful device  
Also included in the games section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs

Its a good way to pass the time
Not perfect but Im still enamored	 Ive had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now and its really great for listening to the radio 
 The player is great 
The battery issue is superficially a concern but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself -) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for ipod battery replacement)   
Given that I find the iPod solution reasonable keep the case sealed and let the battery be changed by a technician once every 2-3 years 
 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist it just mixes up the titles) 
 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apples small (though luxiourious admittedly) island 
 Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones stereo etc)  
 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use 
  I have almost dropped the ipod several times just because it is so smooth
