The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousins player was relatively new it was riddled with scratches
 These issues aside the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one you cant be without one
  These are nice ones and you get great sound at first but again they break if you even think mean things about them 
 And Im really not that rough with things 
 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature it would be nice to have extra storage not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back draining the battery once you get it helps but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
Its a good way to pass the time
The Battery does not last 12 hours
