  PC users have a lot of choices but based on what Ive heard and read the iPod really is the best all-around athough being a Mac product it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software
Whether youre on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music you could definitely do much much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple
  With accessories you can make the iPod into a digital recorder broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster 
It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind
Someone wrote that they havent been able to upload songs from burned cds I have not found this to be so 
My friend has this unit while not experience it much I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy and its definitely the most overrated gadget in history 
I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod mini - basically for ease of use and the feel it gives
