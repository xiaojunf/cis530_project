i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  
for the money apex machines have good features  
or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white  
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  
what can i say  i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever  quality design  stable  plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies  
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait  
there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote
