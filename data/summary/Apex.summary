output through component connections looks very good  on my non-hd tv  
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well )  
seemed like a good deal  but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes   no disc   
had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  
lot s of other features that i need to find out about  
i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one  
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line  but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy
