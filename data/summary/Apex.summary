purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it  
i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  
or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white  
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds 
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg  kodak pic s and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up   
the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  
for the most part this is a good dvd player  
but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there  
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs  
maybe it s good for tvs with not so good color settings  but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures

i find this to be a great feature  
well  this apex dvd player turned out great  
any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support  
you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere  
nice machines  but i consider their quality pretty low now  
i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd s  after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it s job  
after we discovered the problems  we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months )  but we never got in touch with themthe customer support telephone number is always busy  and they do not answer their web customer support  
they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy  
it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up

it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait  
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting  
i tried calling the support number for a week  several times a day  and always got a busy signal  
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  
lot s of other features that i need to find out about  
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs  using a multitude of connection methods  and i still can t get a video signal from the machine  
they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem  
i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today  
think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player  
though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days )  i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help
