just want a wireless router for home or your very small business you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it 
It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow  
There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured  
In fact it supports the new WPA encryption standard which is WAY better than WEP  
If you want to work wirelessly this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now             
What is really needed with these are plug-ins (ever present software controls) standard from the operating system (OS) (Windows Mac Linux etc
I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners seldom falling below the very good range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router
