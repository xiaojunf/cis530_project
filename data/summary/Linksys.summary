Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best 
Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself 
Best decision Ive made in a long time 
Compatability with other devices is excellent too Ive only found one 11b device that wont work with its mixed mode (and it wont work with *anyones* mixed mode)
If it is needed to make a multi-100 MB disk tranfer (such as back-up copies) it makes sense to connect through the wired network  
If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL its probably not going to be noticeable 
This router does everything that it is supposed to do so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it 
Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry  
Unlike other reviewers I have found the support to be responsive almost no wait time on the phone and relatively knowledgeable 
The reason is simple one word and security

Best decision Ive made in a long time 
The box proudly displays SecureEasySetup (TM) Wireless Made Simple One Touch Setup Button Easy Start Easy Security Easy Everyday   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial 
I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself 
But the product iself is great  
My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable 
 I have two linksys routers one wireless g and the other cabled 
It is a good place for new users who want to feel safe and they do provide a good measure of safety but they are not the total answer  
I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners seldom falling below the very good range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router  
I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC as and when needed 
If you want to work wirelessly this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now

Unless you backed up the documents and other things you created (data) that will be lost too  
Its probably a fine router but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality  
With a little knowledge and tweaking you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem 
But eventually I found my way to live assistance through their site (thank GOODNESS) where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that I could at least use it 
Now that the 11g spec is final and a new firmware has been released supporting it the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network  
Yes the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India but the guy was easy to understand and he helped solve the problem 
Dont worry though the primary computer located by the Linksys can be connected by wire this makes for a solid and fast connection to the Net  
I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product
You have to look to the Net tech service help lines and FAQ sites on your router to find out how to solve most of the typical problems  
anted to rate the router higher than 1 star due to its security easy of use etc
