The range is terrific I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard
Yes the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India but the guy was easy to understand and he helped solve the problem 
Best practice is learn how to setup encryption 
Its easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesnt do a good job of explaining why its important  
The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it 
I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues  
Unlike other reviewers I have found the support to be responsive almost no wait time on the phone and relatively knowledgeable
