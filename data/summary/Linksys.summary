little to no networking experience just in case the automatic CD method has issues  
The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server 
The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there but should be The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half 
just want a wireless router for home or your very small business you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it 
Compatability with other devices is excellent too Ive only found one 11b device that wont work with its mixed mode (and it wont work with *anyones* mixed mode)
I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself 
They then send in Trojans Worms (programs that extract and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties to steal information or take control  
The other issue is how secure do you want it  
There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the knowledge database at linksyscom and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one Id already found during a search of my own  
But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 19216211 I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop

there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth 
Now that the 11g spec is final and a new firmware has been released supporting it the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network  
I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 12Ghz laptops CPU when using the wireless at full speed  
Anyway after learning that the Speedboost feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was) and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet but only between computers on the network) I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v5) 
The documentation was just horrible 
They then send in Trojans Worms (programs that extract and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties to steal information or take control  
To set up the xbox wap and ethernest bridge with the encryption on was less then 30 mins 
True you dont need more than an access point and a wired one at that to use as a protective firewall  
I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit and some wanted features like a list of computers accessing my wireless is not easily found on my router   
This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time

Itll make life a lot easier and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review  
You have to look to the Net tech service help lines and FAQ sites on your router to find out how to solve most of the typical problems  
But eventually I found my way to live assistance through their site (thank GOODNESS) where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that I could at least use it

I know I am getting specific but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment based on how close the base unit is to the PC card 
I call tech support which was clearly overseas and Im pretty sure he understood me about as well as I understood him 
There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router and everybody is happy with it 
If you have good networking knowledge youll abandon the wizard use the 100-page online manual and be fine   
But the product iself is great
