The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into what diaper smell in less time than that
The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full
I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it and that helps but when its hot out- well just be prepared
Great product easy to use economical effective absolutly fabulous
We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it
There is no odor and it is very easy to use
Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ
