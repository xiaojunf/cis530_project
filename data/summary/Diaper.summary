There is no comparison the chanp is easy and smell free the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isnt any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ
Well the Champ has survived its first year with our son and it is great
The container is hard to open which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toystoo) I dont consider these difficulties but features for the older baby
We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month 
I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time it is that simple
I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly but that is not a big deal
We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it
This is really a nice diaper pail
Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE
(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail but that is rare--and it usually just means that weve crammed too much in there and need to change the bag

We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it
In fact I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old that I bought one for our new babys room
This is really a nice diaper pail
It holds almost a weeks worth of diapers and you dont need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work
He thinks it is magic when the diaper disappears  
It works easily with one hand which is important
There is no odor and it is very easy to use
And best of all no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags
We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did
The diaper champ is the best

Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it
But like I stated its better then a trash can but Im not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie
The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle
There is no odor and it is very easy to use
The champ the baby bjorn fluerville diaper bag and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase
It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and its fairly inexpensive as baby products go
Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesnt really contain the smell
We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it
 (Being a diaper pail Id prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary)     
As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes
