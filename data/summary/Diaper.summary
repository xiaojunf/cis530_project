With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones
Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ
Wow - was that disappointing and we didnt even have it 6 months before it broke
This is really a nice diaper pail
Regardless to this fact I believe the Champ is the best way to go
We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags
 (Being a diaper pail Id prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary)     
I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented)
Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly 
I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly but that is not a big deal

1  The Diaper Champ doesnt require special refills that are expensive and hard to find
The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome
Special bags are expensive hard to find and you never have enough
If you have a really sensitive nose I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ once you have to open it to empty out the full bag youre quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor and scented bags help with that
Im concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse
This is a GREAT product
It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags easy to clean and most important easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle
I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special diaper trash bags necessary
2) The Champ uses regular store bags
Regardless to this fact I believe the Champ is the best way to go

He thinks it is magic when the diaper disappears  
It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags easy to clean and most important easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle
Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers this is the truly the only diaper pail to get
I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags
We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it
We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $600 and they work great
it wasnt much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash
There is no odor and it is very easy to use
Heres the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula which is what gives baby waste a foul smell and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them
And the biggest plus is that you dont have to buy any expensive refills
