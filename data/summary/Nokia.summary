nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  
the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life )  
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  
when talking the voice is not very clear  
service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great  
first of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  
the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only
