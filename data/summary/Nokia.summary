i ve had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola  sony ericsson  nokia etc ) and in my opinion  nokia has the best menus and promps hands down  
it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier  
this really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  
i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as t-mobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  
overall this is a slightly better than average phone  
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  
the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors
