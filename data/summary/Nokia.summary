from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  
navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  
i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile  
if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  
every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data  meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference )  
this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology )  
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  
i ve had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola  sony ericsson  nokia etc ) and in my opinion  nokia has the best menus and promps hands down  
like some other reviewers  i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program  
small size

the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone  and what a great phone it is  
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  
i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous  
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  
i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones  
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  
i ve compared this phone to others such as 6100  siemens sl55  
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email
