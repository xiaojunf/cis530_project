This router does everything that it is supposed to do so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it 
It was a very quick setup and installation in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up 
By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do 
It works great i am usually at the full 54 mbps although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is 
It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house 
There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router and everybody is happy with it 
I do not really know why some people are tearing this router 
apart on their reviews they are talking about installation problems and what not 
Its the easiest thing to setup i thought and i am only 16So with all that said BUY THE ROUTER     
Its probably a fine router but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality  
If you have good networking knowledge youll abandon the wizard use the 100-page online manual and be fine   
I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there so I was able to puzzle my way through it but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages  
It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does) without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC 
After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is admin) it refused to go past step 8 
provide no printed manual 
I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website 
It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD 
But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard 
You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the User Guide tab which loads the manual  
The box proudly displays SecureEasySetup (TM) Wireless Made Simple One Touch Setup Button Easy Start Easy Security Easy Everyday   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial 
If youre buying this product and operate on a Mac platform ditch the CD and go directly to live assistance on the Linksys website     
I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself 
I run on Mac OSX and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison 
(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router)
HOWEVER configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup 
I am a generally computer-savvy person not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require) but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support 
en I opened the box I found little more than a few advertisement flyers and instructions to run the enclosed CD before plugging in the router  
(Didnt find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later
) After messing about a bit with the CD I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips 
I even downloaded the products user manual - useless 
The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac 
But eventually I found my way to live assistance through their site (thank GOODNESS) where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that I could at least use it 
I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so
meone would just give me some instructions in plain English  
The router comes with a TON of options for setup but sadly enough I had no idea what most of it meant 
What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS
 and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance 
I dont mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box but please have some instructions *somewhere
* Im giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable 
But the product iself is great  
If you have a Mac I dont think you should totally discount this product 
Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if youre prone to high blood pressure      
For an item that is not even available in Best Buy and the other major stores when I went to buy it the fact that  has these in and out of stock and that I received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation  
Having never hooked up a wireless network before I took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit and used their included CD 
Having seen the problems that some others were having with setup only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions I decided to do it that way right out of the box 
This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time 
ell you to shut off and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on resulted in a delightful install 
The CD determined my internet connection determined my system configuration asked me a few questions and bingo I was up and running  
I bought the PC Card for laptops as well and that was just as easy to install 
Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house 
Pertaining to the speed issue I got 54Mps while I was in the same room 
A standard modem works at 56K tops 
This router works at 54Mbps thats megabyte not kilobyte 
So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem 
I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e
nd and 100 to 150 upload speed 
I know I am getting specific but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment based on how close the base unit is to the PC card 
What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router so dont hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network  
Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies 
As soon as you click on a site it appears on the screen  
Anyhow just for reference I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast 
The operating system is Windows XP 
They do supply instructions when using Windows ME 98 etc that includes one more step than XP 
All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment 
I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA 
Ironically the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue so now I have no problems what so ever 
Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity  
New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration 
All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network 
Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router 
You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network  
But I believe for stability this extra price is worth spending 
It did not take me that long to set this up but it did require *not* following the instructions  
I had an old wired Linksys router  
The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it 
There was a big sticker inside the box saying RUN CD FIRST - DO NOT DISCONNECT YOUR CURRENT ROUTER  
And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs  
So I ran the CD but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old so the CD s/w did not recognize it  
There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual it did not give an answer readily on what do to  
If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever I might be stumped at this point  
But since I do have a little experience I simply disconnected my old router and put in the new one  
So then running the CD everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again  
The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection  
There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured  
But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 19216211 I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop  
The router works fine for both wired and wireless  
I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly  
I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with 
little to no networking experience just in case the automatic CD method has issues  
Here is the big news to everyone this is a consumer level product 
This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment 
You will not be able to run 100s users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line 
People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves 
They need to step up and buy an enterprise level piece of hardware for a lot more money 
That aside this is not that bad of a product 
I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it 
With a little knowledge and tweaking you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem 
If you have users that use P2P you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers 
P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of
On the subject of Third Party firmware Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux 
Because of that a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware 
So if you type in Linksys firmware into Google or A9 you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux) 
The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there but should be The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half 
Simply put the hardware is just too small to run Linux which is a really bummer since I found it fun to play with my Linksys WRT54Gs firmware  
However if you are not a tech person and
just want a wireless router for home or your very small business you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it 
Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself 
Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption 
All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G  
If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G sorry but you need to get the WRT54GS router 
I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router just get the WRT54G     
I had a Linksys wired 80211B router and wireless access point which worked well but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device  
The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the Speedbooster version  
The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating  
I tried the CD setup program without any luck  
Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions  
A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running  
No hold time  
Yes the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India but the guy was easy to understand and he helped solve the problem 
I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem then go to a Linksys webs
ite  wwwlinksyscom/connect  I clicked on NetSet Assistant and let it do its thing  
As far as WEP configuration make your adjustments after youve set up the router using the default setup  
Itll make life a lot easier and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review  
This is my fourth Linksys product and aside from the rough start Im very satisfied with this router     
I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs 
This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE 
For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed 
The range is terrific I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard
I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP  
I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home  
I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues  
I wrongly thought that it was the router  
After countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc
I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly taking up space  
Ive since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic 
Be sure to call your ISP with the modems MAC address to get online  
My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes  
Also some ISPs give you a discount if you supply your own modem
I got this for my aunt who pretty much knows nothing about computers 
It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasnt called me yet with any problems 
Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what youre doing 
there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth 
And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow 
A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years 
Id also recommend wireless products made by Belkin 
ive had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems     
I upgraded from an older 80111b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security and of course speed 
However this product performed well below my expectation  
The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music or copy large files over the local network  
I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router  
Although it will work for a few minutes it will eventually hang 
This behavior (hanging) also occurs when I transfer large files between my PCs  
After some research on the Net I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G version 3 which Amazon currently sells)  
If you just use the router to surf the web this router should serve your needs  
As I mentioned in my first paragraph it supports WPA security which is far superior to WEP  
In addition it is very easy to setup  
anted to rate the router higher than 1 star due to its security easy of use etc  
The reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost     
I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC as and when needed 
So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections  
My next project will be to try out sveasoft firmware to increase this unit capabilities and wireless range     
I used to own a $20 after rebate cheapo wireless router that I thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking 
Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot  
The cheap router I used to own had very minimal feature in the configurations menu and less security options then the Linksys WRT54G 
But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time 
I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs   router[+2] You wont regret it 
The setup was very easy 
Just follow the instructions carefully its all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time 
No more connection
The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didnt even need a manual to setup correctly  
Even though you could get a cheap router these days Im happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys 
The quality is significant and youll be very happy from saving time and the headache      
It is a nice router in all ways but one  
A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet 
That is you cannot access the internet at all  
All lights blink and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN  
Just no internet  
You have to unplug the unit to get it to work again  
I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it but I bought it anyway 
I replaced my D-link 80211b router because it could not hold a connection continuously  
See my other reviews for the details  
I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 12Ghz laptops CPU when using the wireless at full speed  
I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 80211b router to g technology and I spent several hours trying to get it to work 
The installation software CD crashed repeatedly 
Thinking the CD was faulty I went to the Linksys website hoping to simply download the setup program but its not available 
I then tried to set up the router through Linksyss browser interface but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly but the connection kept dropping and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue I gave up   
Im returning this as Im not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so 
I couldnt get the install wizard to work  
However setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze  
Its easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesnt do a good job of explaining why its important  
If you buy you should disable the SSID Broadcast use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual)  
For effort free wireless network adaptors use the linksys USB adaptor  
If you need convincing on the security side read Wireless Hacks (this is a book of excellent tips not just security) published by OReilly  
Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it     
My old Linksys router recently died after 25 years of service 
While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys  
The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process 
I had to change the channel of the router like the channel on a cordless phone to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v26 
I also had to do this with the old router  
I used Linksys technical support several times 
Unlike other reviewers I have found the support to be responsive almost no wait time on the phone and relatively knowledgeable 
Granted I am a professional technologist with years of experience  
Overall this router seems like a reasonably priced product th
at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support     
Now that the 11g spec is final and a new firmware has been released supporting it the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network  
Its easy and really works with some incredible range  
Compatability with other devices is excellent too Ive only found one 11b device that wont work with its mixed mode (and it wont work with *anyones* mixed mode)
However your PC cards should also be Linksys g rated as interoperability has been a problem on some b cards 
The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients 
Therefore if you have a really robust connection (like a T3) this will help 
If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL its probably not going to be noticeable 
Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding     
This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards 
My experience with installation was quite good  
I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system)  
The card basically installed itself and the install wizard on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card)  
The setup wasnt quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account) though the documentation for this was staightforward  
The whole process was probably about 10 minutes  
Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and
running the installation wizard again  
I havent tried to set up any advanced features on the router but it is not difficult to set up for basic use  
The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up  
I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners seldom falling below the very good range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router  
The transmission speed is also quite good with pages loading very quickly  
I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility in that the mixed mode feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router     
I have been using my router for some months now I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but thats a laptop problem 
As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market 
I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit and some wanted features like a list of computers accessing my wireless is not easily found on my router   
All in all its a good router if you dont have the cash for a Speedbooster one 
I upgraded my network to wireless with this router  
I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one turned everything on in the right order and it was up and running with no problems  
All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well     
This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers worked great for about a year 
In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year 
My opion is concentrate on what you need now This product has EXELENT range holds a teady connection hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now 
I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product
It took me three days to the tune of Neil Youngs song Piece Of Cr-- to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to  
There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the knowledge database at linksyscom and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one Id already found during a search of my own  
The only way I got the thing working (this was with a DirecWay satellite)
I just upgraded to the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G router last month and I am very happy with the quality of the product  
This router acts as a wireless access point 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device  
Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card 
I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection 
I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card 
The inital setup of the router was simple 
The PC card setup was painless as well 
Havent had any of the issues Ive been reading in the other reviews 
The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server 
Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks
Cisco (lets be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device 
Theyve gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5 
They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time 
Interestingly they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 30 to 31 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 40  
There may be many theories as to why theyve done this but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices 
Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done 
If it was a software comaptiblity issue or a component availability issue explain it to us so we dont have to theorize on the motives  
In the mean time Ill buy a different ro
uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections) 
Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 31 if you can find it     
This is a good product but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not  
Id recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware     
Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right
My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic 
First I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart  
Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR 
Unfortunately Linksys does not write the best documentation  
What is really needed with these are plug-ins (ever present software controls) standard from the operating system (OS) (Windows Mac Linux etc
) that use some type of connect standard where the OS does all the work  
Why own one of these things then especially if you only have one computer  
The reason is simple one word and security  
The average Windows based computer can exist on an unprote
cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address and access it 
They then send in Trojans Worms (programs that extract and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties to steal information or take control  
In some cases you cant even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit  
Its no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition  
Unless you backed up the documents and other things you created (data) that will be lost too  
What does a router access point do to help prevent this  
For one it clones the Mac address on many systems  
A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier  
Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address
from the cable modem you are using  
Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet the Mac address must be copied because its whats recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network  
In addition your port address is now the router not your computer  
Networks on the outside cant see your computer and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly all they see is the router and what cant be seen cant be accessed  
You now set the software to allow what access you will allow  
Here is where many typical problems begin  
Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels  
You have to look to the Net tech service help lines and FAQ sites on your router to find out how to solve most of the typical problems  
These generally range from not connecting at all to hosting 
online games or downloading files from sites with different security levels  
With wireless routers you have another potential hole the wireless connection  
Someone next door may have a wireless system too and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls  
Computer novices should have a computer savvy person install and set-up their router  
Dont try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge  
Ok so what can we say about this particular network product  
Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry  
Linksys is made by Cisco the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size  
ying to point out they have experience and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best  
You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this and most Linksys models  
Why the four-port wireless model you ask 
You may only have one computer  
True you dont need more than an access point and a wired one at that to use as a protective firewall  
Still if you think there may be more computers in the future and there is a need for a multi-port network  
If that happens youll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection rather than pay for two services or more at multiple single-connect prices
Moreover the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons so getting the added functionality is at little and sometimes no cost  Well if your network has or will have computers in other rooms you may not want to wire your house for Ethernet 
speed of a wired connection  
Dont worry though the primary computer located by the Linksys can be connected by wire this makes for a solid and fast connection to the Net  
My last topic concerns the security setup you do or have done with your router  
Remember you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes your computer and now your router 
The other issue is how secure do you want it  
Even things like the downloaded files and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive  
Another thing you may do are the many file transfers needed to playing network games  Some settings allow you to play but not host a game others wont even let It may take several attempts and reading a lot of FAQs or network help sites to fix some of these issues 
However many you open up remember you are putting holes in your firewall making your computer
You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system  
They provide you with their network security as a part of the service but for a price  
It is a good place for new users who want to feel safe and they do provide a good measure of safety but they are not the total answer  
Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs  The purchase of a router is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself these days      
Im using sveasofts firmware but search the web for more information about it--you may find you dont approve of the authors tactics which I only learned about after Id paid my $20 subscription     
OK I never read the manual  
I tried to do this by instinct and its not intuitive unless you are a network geek 
I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else  
When I gave up and called their help desk they sent me to a web site I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly 
The darn thing works as promised and its amazingly cheap too 
Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC 
If you want to work wirelessly this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now             
To be honest I got it just to link up my Xbox (attached to a WET11 wireless ethernet bridge)to my cable modem (ISP Comcast) so I could get rid of the 70 feet of ethernet cable that ran down the hall 
Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PCs too it  
The setup was a breeze I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge 
To set up the xbox wap and ethernest bridge with the encryption on was less then 30 mins 
Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace 
Nor did I need any settings from my ISP 
The setup software did everything 
to the wrld of wireless and it couldnt have gone better 
My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable 
In a week of use ive never had to reboot the router 
There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (24 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem 
A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality 
I am getting better speeds on all my web programs 
There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router 
I had a lot of problems setting it up since the software given along with it is buggy 
The firmware has bugs too so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys 
After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs  
The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually 
This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user my old Dlink DI52
4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this 
At first I was going to give it a really bad review 
The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit  
The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware 
But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program 
 I have two linksys routers one wireless g and the other cabled 
Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best 
When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router 
Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important  
Purchased this router a few months back NO PROBLEMS whatsoever  
In fact it supports the new WPA encryption standard which is WAY better than WEP  
Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA 
Feature wise its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there     
One device Tivo Series 1 DVR is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable or a wireless connection 
Got the Linksys after reading some reviews 
Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac 
Reset the network tried the connection and its working like a charm 
The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 80211b speeds and not 80211g 
However since this Router is backward compatible that doesnt pose a problem at all  
()  Like most SOHO routers it has nearly non-existant logging 
SOHO boxes dont give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing 
If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address youll have that record but thats it 
Im disappoointed Linksys still doesnt allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations) 
If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone elses LNKSYS router cause they didnt change the default SS
ID on their router  
MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic 
MAC filtering isnt too hard and it is just a config change on the router 
Easy and a basic step but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area maybe not enough for privacy  
Best practice is learn how to setup encryption 
WEP encryption is weak but most computer people couldnt figure out how to break it 
Problem is sometimes you cant get a visiting laptop to work with certain encryption 
Encryption means people cant join OR read what youre doing         
Ive had this Linksys router  
No down time great signal strength  
Worth every penny plus for those who are really into networking  
There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features  
Setup is totally breeze and Linksyss web site is pretty easy to navigate  
Now this router is not the cheapest on the market  
But if you want to get into networking and running wireless  
The fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion 
So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  heres the link to firmware updates http//wwwsveasoftcom/forum6html      
Absolutely no problems with this router 
I downloaded and updated the firmware and followed the easy setup instructions 
A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance  
I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks  
Speed is not a problem      
I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 80211b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG 
I cant notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour 
After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine 
If you currently own a wireless router (80211b) dont rush to replace it 
As far as Linksys goes I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems     
Getting the router setup in a vanilla configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy and I was able to do this no problem
First let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house However I realized the other day that I hadnt even secured it (yes stupid me) 
As Id just purchased a new computer with a Wireless G adapter I figured Id upgrade the router as well and set it up as its supposed to be  
Though admittedly I am a novice at networking I am not an idiot and can read directions 
Quite frankly though Ive never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware 
The documentation was just horrible 
When you open the package the first thing you see is Run CD first 
ter finds the router anyway but its unsecured 
I call tech support which was clearly overseas and Im pretty sure he understood me about as well as I understood him 
After 15 minutes on hold and 10 painful minutes with this guy he basically tells me to download a file from their website which will walk me through 
I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better 
Anyway after learning that the Speedboost feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was) and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet but only between computers on the network) I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v5) 
Best decision Ive made in a long time 
First the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City 
Second the setup CD actually worked perfectly 
he brower-based administrative screen with no problems 
I still need to read up on some of the security settings etc to fully understand all thats up there but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router 
The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4 
Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with MAC settings etc 
If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup     
I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router 
Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic 
I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box 
Two walls apart from it the signal would start failing 
When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router I thought Id happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway since youve got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage 
Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house   setup[-1] Firstly I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair replacing the original ones 
Then the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul
d be in the same IP range and see each other 
Basically I set up the box to work as router (
) as opposed to gateway disabled DHCP and gave the router an IP number within the range served by the DHCP service from the modem   
Also I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol and created a corresponding profile in my notebook  
All this took a couple of hours fidling as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldnt know if there is help there  
Having done all this I was quite pleased to see that all corners I needed were decently covered by the signal 
The box is upstairs and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard 
If it is needed to make a multi-100 MB disk tranfer (such as back-up copies) it makes sense to connect through the wired network  
Apart from speed the signal is consistent and works without interruptions etc 
the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case     
It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow  
Its very frustrating to try to complete school work or work only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes 
The tech support is worthless too
