The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far 
 There isnt much features on the iPod at all except games
My friend has this unit while not experience it much I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy and its definitely the most overrated gadget in history 
SOUND QUALITY The iPods sound quality is pretty good
 The Creative player sounds a bit better but not anything to worry about
  DURABILITY Not good First problem if you havent seen the news recently the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months
This is really stupid to me 18 months for a battery isnt good actually its medicore 
iRivers battery lasts four to five years 
 However the Creative and iRiver players are (Rios isnt) and they only cost around $30 to replace while iPod charges shipping and technical support 
The iPods battery 15 years 
 Another thing you should know the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky and scratches very easily
 While all MP3 players are easy to scratch the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver
 FEATURES Really there arent any features unless you call the games a feature 
 There is also no voice recording something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesnt
 There is an alarm and timer but most MP3 players have this feature
  EASE OF USE/DESIGN The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player and if you cant figure this out you shouldnt even own one
I just dont like it the weird thing is I dont know why I dislike it
Anyhow adding music to the player is easy
 BATTERY LIFE Pretty medicore at 12 hours the Creative iAudio Rio and iRiver players last longer 
OVERALL I highly dislike the iPod even though the sound quality and design is above-average 
Maybe in their 5th generation theyll add features to the iPod But for now pleases dont buy this and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead 
The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company 
The software with the iPod includes iTunes which allows you to play the music on your computer rip CDs onto your computer and move your music from the computer to the iPod 
This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection  
 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read 
 The song quality of the iPod is excellent and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory for most users
 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time per charge 
I use my iPod all the time 
The problem with my iPod 
 I had to send it in for repair and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me
However he quickly helped me and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now 
 The product I rate five stars 
  Plus if you order from Amazoncom they will exchange it for you no problem  
Id never had an MP3 player before so this was a new one on me
 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it 
 This one has a color display which I like a lot being very visual 
I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and very importantly the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous 
 The sound is just fine 
 I use it to listen to language tapes and to play Earl by the Dixie Chicks incessantly  
 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved
12 hours is about average and it has an AC adapter in the box with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80% and 4 hours for a full charge
Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable so that you dont accidently hit something in your pocket 
 Cons No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesnt have
 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature it would be nice to have extra storage not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back draining the battery once you get it helps but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player 
 This is definately worth the money to have but certain aspects of it doesnt make it the best     
I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead
The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO PHOTO GAME MUSIC all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET     oh yeah even audio books anything   
Its a plug n play device recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer 
I had a Casio unit which had given great service and would have been happy to get another one but was tempted by the iPods sleek design storage capacity connection options- - firewire and USB and its integration with iTunes   
The battery issue is superficially a concern but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself -) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for ipod battery replacement)   
And its easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files so I can also retire my ZIP drive 
 The iPod is a very nice product which given reasonable care should give a lot of service      
 So far in the month that I have had it I have had to take it in for service twice
  This is a hassle of course but Im not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction cold weather or misuse by yours truly  
In addition I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours and it can take four hours for a full charge
 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs) and as far as I can tell all of them play at near-cd quality
 Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones stereo etc)  
 I have several hundred songs from burned albums at they all worked fine 
 As for iTunes I dont find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player but it is good enough 
  In the end I havent used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money 
when i got the ipod i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out 
i didnt touch the product 
 a week passed but it was never picked up
 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee  im at my wits end with this company 
I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago and Ive been pretty disappointed so far
The Battery does not last 12 hours  
Like I said Ive had my ipod for six short months and Id estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most
  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it 
 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs  
 Features click wheel to navigate ability to work with Windows or Mac optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 10 or 20 seconds) ability to download PDA info automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer 
  With accessories you can make the iPod into a digital recorder broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster 
For Mac owners youll need Mac OS X 1015 or later (1034 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in
Because it is a hard drive it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage
  The weight is heavier than many digital players but I like the solid feel 
 So dissapointing however I am now just gonna assume its gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and Ill just have to live with it and i will buy a case for it tomorrow I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE Other than that I am super extied about this product I will update the review later in a few days   
great product with Limited Services
 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod
  It was worth it as I use it to this very day
  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage except the inevitable scratches
  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment and surprisingly wasnt as expensive as its reputation normally holds  
After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players I was anxious to try it out 
 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads 
 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it 
 If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 25 years of daily listening
  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month and dont store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp is harmful to the batterys life) 
 Finally if your battery gives out you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and youre good to go for another 25 years (or longer if battery technology improves)  
They wear out pretty easily when youre changing batteries every week or so 
Given that I find the iPod solution reasonable keep the case sealed and let the battery be changed by a technician once every 2-3 years 
Finally compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb and also consider ease of use 
This is the best purchase Ive made in a very long time
I have wanted one for a long time but just didnt want to spend the money
 I wish I had a long time ago
 The sound quality is excellent accessing the music is easy and the controls are generally well thought out 
  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model which is way too big for what I really need I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity 
Perhaps over time I will fill it up but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used I have a long way to go
The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use 
(It sure does look nice though)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere the quality of the audio is excellent the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive and the storage capacity and battery life are huge     
 Still my favorite MP3 player	 Is it overpriced 
  Using the software iTunes is relatively simple you just plug the USB cable in wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod
  At first I primarily used it as a stand-alone portable player but it wasnt until I decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that I truly adored this device
 I mean it would be nice if one day iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path  
By far the best MP3 player Ive ever used	
 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers
However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires surprise surprise) 
I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and its still working flawlessly
For a sleeker smaller and more average MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful
 Also some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files whereas the iPod does NOT 
 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if youre an audiophile this will bother you - frankly I cant tell the difference)  
Also I dont like how when I first set up my iPod it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation it will not configure the iPod and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod hard drive to a new letter
 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use 
In the meantime users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer its impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which were not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours  
 The design as mentioned above is sleek cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good but its always hard to tell these days) 
 The battery life lastes 12 hours and charges quickly (As mentioned above the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all) Once youve downloaded your music you can access the tracks by artist genre album composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - eg covers of songs) etc
 The  sound quality is great 
The game plays a segment of a song and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others 
When I first saw music trivia quiz I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - its not
Its a good way to pass the time
 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5000 songs more than youre ever likely to need at any one time
Its just my personal advice but youre saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod its very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything
  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and for the price I highly recommend it
 At $290 (the price I paid) its quite a bargain
  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as Im concerned and the best MP3 player on the market 
Whether youre on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music you could definitely do much much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple
  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the hold switch 
 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently and had the opportunity to play with my cousins 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it
 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer
  Overall I think the iPod is a good player although I would note some features that turned me off 
  While I like the minimialism of the player I try to avoid plastic products made of white- they tend to yellow with age 
While they have released those tattoos for the players I think those just look cheap and gaudy especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed  
The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousins player was relatively new it was riddled with scratches
  While hes not the most careful guy in the world it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience they look terrible scratched up  
THE CLICKWHEEL Again I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread 
As a student I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me 
 BATTERY Compared to the other players on the market the iPod has one of the worst batteries around
 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge respe
 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one Im aware of that has this and its 5 GB) this can be an issue  
IN SUMMARY This is a good basic player  Its not for everyone and if youre in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have and see how they stack up 
 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apples iTunes-only program
  But since a lot of these MP3 players are marketed on aesthetics do go to your local store or borrow a friends and see how the product actually feels and works
  This may be the player for you but its not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player and others are ahead of it in certain areas so practice some caution when you buy     
	 If like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3s buy this one 
If you want colour screens photos videos etc buy the latest (extremely expensive) model I think the new 60GB has all the extras 
  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver 
Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these the Creative Zens is only 90 days way too short 
Both from unspecialist makes and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts and has not invested the money that Apple has 
  As far as an actual player is concerned the iPod is next to none
 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s unlike the iPod 
But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player
 The iPod package comes with everything you need the AC adaptor firewire cable (quicker than USB but slower than USB 2 which it also gives) those snazzy and powerfull headphones and of course the player 
 Actually I had two the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out  I didnt tell them I had dropped it once) 
Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary) and as luck would have it this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check
  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one
  The major change from the previous model other than the extra 5G for the same price is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter and the already minimal buttons (menu play/pause forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10000 stolen mp3s 
 I like the click wheel OK but actually the one problem Ive had with this my third iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets stuck meaning either it wont respond at all or it jumps down playlists uncontrollably 
 The thing is naturally youre going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it
The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing you just cant beat that with a stick  
But seriously though how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen
 The other thing is the earbuds  
 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two 
  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board
  PC users have a lot of choices but based on what Ive heard and read the iPod really is the best all-around athough being a Mac product it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software
A lot of the reviews Ive read talk about IPODS in general
 Im writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model
 I ordered the mini from amazon and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store  
  After talking to the salesman I instead bought the 4G 20GB (that stands for 4th generation it looks like a mini - same features) and didnt know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell including on amazon are still 3G
 The player is great 
 For about $5 6 dollars you can get an extended warranty and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies
 Overall this product is AWESOME 
 All the cool features of the mini but with 20GB instead of 5  
No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place 
 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great
 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger
The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used 
I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod mini - basically for ease of use and the feel it gives 
   The click wheel is much easier to use compared to the previous generations models with the touch screen 
 This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now 
Does not come with the dock remote control or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price so you can still end up with the same accessories and a new generation iPod for the same money
   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time 
The first battery charge lasted only about six hours 
That may be due to the fact that I used the menus a lot and had it hooked up to the Griffin iTrip (The iTrip works great) for most of that time
 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours
 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the click sound to get this much life out of it   
I was worried about what the sound quality would be like but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound
 The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen
This is only a problem at night during the day the screen is very easy to see 
You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely) so its only a minor issue  
 The first time I took it in the car and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles thousands of songs to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience
 Although iPods have been around for a few years they didnt really get hot until now 
I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it 
 The only problem is the battery life
 After about 3-4 months you see your battery draining faster than it should 
If you look on Google or around the webs many search engines you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price 
Not perfect but Im still enamored	 Ive had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now and its really great for listening to the radio 
 I am so in love with this thing I can hardly stand it   
Its still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology youre getting so dont let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover 
The ear buds that come with it look cheap but the sound quality is amazing 
  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time  
However I have found that converting my CDs and MP3s into the iTunes library for upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time
 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist it just mixes up the titles) 
Sales of Apples mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years 
Thats a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful influential and trendy product
Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated because do I rate my personal connotation on it 
Theres no two ways about it I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago
 However having said that this could just be because I havent really had enough time to experience it in its entirety
