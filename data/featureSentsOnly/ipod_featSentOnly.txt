The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far 
 There isnt much features on the iPod at all except games
My friend has this unit while not experience it much I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy and its definitely the most overrated gadget in history 
SOUND QUALITY The iPods sound quality is pretty good
 The Creative player sounds a bit better but not anything to worry about
 It has an equalizer but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod 
  DURABILITY Not good First problem if you havent seen the news recently the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months
This is really stupid to me 18 months for a battery isnt good actually its medicore 
iRivers battery lasts four to five years 
 However the Creative and iRiver players are (Rios isnt) and they only cost around $30 to replace while iPod charges shipping and technical support 
The iPods battery 15 years 
 Another thing you should know the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky and scratches very easily
 While all MP3 players are easy to scratch the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver
 Also not liking the gel case 
iRivers seems a lot more sturdier than the iPods
 FEATURES Really there arent any features unless you call the games a feature 
There is no FM tuner while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner) the iRiver H10-20GB the Rio Karma and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners 
 There is also no voice recording something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesnt
 There is an alarm and timer but most MP3 players have this feature
  EASE OF USE/DESIGN The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player and if you cant figure this out you shouldnt even own one
The Click Wheel is a great design something no one else came up with (however the iRiver has a touchpad) 
I just dont like it the weird thing is I dont know why I dislike it
 Maybe because it doesnt have a lot of skins to choose from like WMP but then again I dislike WMP as well because its slow on my computer 
Anyhow adding music to the player is easy
 BATTERY LIFE Pretty medicore at 12 hours the Creative iAudio Rio and iRiver players last longer 
 CUSTOMER SERVICE Awful Listen to this one remember the battery statement I made earlier 
If your battery dies and its still under warranty guess what youre out of luck because Apple doesnt cover the battery in the iPod warranty 
 There technical service isnt helpful either they just read whats on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it
OVERALL I highly dislike the iPod even though the sound quality and design is above-average 
Maybe in their 5th generation theyll add features to the iPod But for now pleases dont buy this and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead 
Since then I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple 
I have an ipod and it is a great buy 
It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand
 Doesnt have alot of good games on it
 the 20 gig because that holds 10000 songs right there and thats alot of songs 
iPod is brilliant but service was awful
How did we listen to music before it
This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it in a choice of digital formats  MP3 AAC etc 
The software with the iPod includes iTunes which allows you to play the music on your computer rip CDs onto your computer and move your music from the computer to the iPod 
iTunes is a great piece of software and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download 
This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection  
 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read 
 The song quality of the iPod is excellent and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory for most users
It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind
 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time per charge 
I use my iPod all the time 
 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents photographs etc 
The problem with my iPod 
 The first one I received skipped songs randomly 
 I had to send it in for repair and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me
However he quickly helped me and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now 
Thank you Apple  You make fabulous products 
 The product I rate five stars 
but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow
  Plus if you order from Amazoncom they will exchange it for you no problem  
iPod will change the way you enjoy music      
Id never had an MP3 player before so this was a new one on me
 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it 
 This one has a color display which I like a lot being very visual 
I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and very importantly the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous 
 The sound is just fine 
It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall which I hear is a step up from the other iPods which require you plug it into a computer to charge it  
I also have been using it as a USB device which just tickles me no end 
Now I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss 
 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved
 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos     
This is a great device but there are its pros and cons 
Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2 
12 hours is about average and it has an AC adapter in the box with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80% and 4 hours for a full charge
 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition) and now the wheel clicks taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus 
Good sound-- Plays very nicely even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic but very compact and sturdy 
 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature it would be nice to have extra storage not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back draining the battery once you get it helps but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
 iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC but depending on your computer expertise this could be a difficult program to use and it is required for an iPod 
No inbox accessories-- An arm strap belt strap case or anything would be nice but nope Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th with moveable parts its easy to damage an iPod at a gym so this is for more casual listeners note the iPod Mini doesnt have moveable parts and is made of titanium
  Comments Overall this is still a great value but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market
  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player 
 This is definately worth the money to have but certain aspects of it doesnt make it the best     
I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead
 A sound decision and a happy customer right here
 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them ) They just didnt know about the ARCHOS gmini400 
Its a plug n play device recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer 
I had a Casio unit which had given great service and would have been happy to get another one but was tempted by the iPods sleek design storage capacity connection options- - firewire and USB and its integration with iTunes   
The battery issue is superficially a concern but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself -) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for ipod battery replacement)   
The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed  
And its easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files so I can also retire my ZIP drive 
 The iPod is a very nice product which given reasonable care should give a lot of service      
 So far in the month that I have had it I have had to take it in for service twice
In addition I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours and it can take four hours for a full charge
 To be sure I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement whenever that may come  
 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs) and as far as I can tell all of them play at near-cd quality
 Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones stereo etc)  
Other than the fact that one cant delete a file directly from the iPod the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use  
Someone wrote that they havent been able to upload songs from burned cds I have not found this to be so 
 I have several hundred songs from burned albums at they all worked fine 
 As for iTunes I dont find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player but it is good enough 
 I havent used it to purchase any files so I dont know about that
  In the end I havent used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money 
Do your research before you buy it and especially talk to other owners      
 ive had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city 
when i got the ipod i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out 
simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier
i didnt touch the product 
 i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box
 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee  im at my wits end with this company 
I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago and Ive been pretty disappointed so far
 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily 
 You must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it  
*	The 20 GB version doesnt actually have 20 GB but 185 GB which makes a difference of roughly 300 songs *	
The Battery does not last 12 hours  
Like I said Ive had my ipod for six short months and Id estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most
  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it 
 You cant change the battery so I dont know what Im going to do in a year or so
My ipod freezes occasionally which is especially annoying when youre in the middle of a game of brick *
If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged they charge you roughly $10550 per minute and blame you for abusing your ipod
 The user support service isnt too great either  
 Its sleek design large memory capacity compatibility with iTunes and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market 
 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs  
This version does not come with a dock although it can be added later as an accessory  Y
You can use it to listen to music or audio books either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive
 Features click wheel to navigate ability to work with Windows or Mac optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 10 or 20 seconds) ability to download PDA info automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer 
Theres even an equalizer (under settings) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic bass booster bass reducer classical dance deep and electronic
  With accessories you can make the iPod into a digital recorder broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster 
 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac but within seconds of plugging it into a PC is automatically reformatted for Windows  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting and takes seconds to change to Mac) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another you will lose all of your music and data when doing so 
 The box comes with iPod ear buds iTunes and iPod software USB 20 and FireWire cables and a home charger 
 You  will need a computer with a six-pin FireWire or USB 20 port (USB 11 
For Mac owners youll need Mac OS X 1015 or later (1034 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in
 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card 
Since nothing is perfect the iPod does have some disadvantages such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes dont buy an iPod)  
Because it is a hard drive it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage
All in all this is a wonderful device  
  The weight is heavier than many digital players but I like the solid feel 
 Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go          
 So dissapointing however I am now just gonna assume its gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and Ill just have to live with it and i will buy a case for it tomorrow I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE Other than that I am super extied about this product I will update the review later in a few days   
great product with Limited Services
 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod
  It was worth it as I use it to this very day
  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage except the inevitable scratches
  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment and surprisingly wasnt as expensive as its reputation normally holds  
 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apples small (though luxiourious admittedly) island 
 However they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers  
After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players I was anxious to try it out 
 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads 
 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service  
Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napsters services 
 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster  
Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice
  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service they are failing to compete with the market 
 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it 
 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times
 If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 25 years of daily listening
  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at wwwapplecom/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month and dont store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp is harmful to the batterys life) 
 Finally if your battery gives out you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and youre good to go for another 25 years (or longer if battery technology improves)  
Ask yourself how often youve seen battery covers break on consumer electronics 
They wear out pretty easily when youre changing batteries every week or so 
Given that I find the iPod solution reasonable keep the case sealed and let the battery be changed by a technician once every 2-3 years 
You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive
 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point  
Finally compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb and also consider ease of use 
The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market
This is the best purchase Ive made in a very long time
The sound is INCREDIBLE very clean very wide dynamic range of bass mids and highs and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast
 I have less than 3 GB worth of music and I dont have any more music in my collection
I have wanted one for a long time but just didnt want to spend the money
 I wish I had a long time ago
 The sound quality is excellent accessing the music is easy and the controls are generally well thought out 
As a Windows user I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance 
The first install did not work correctly and would never transfer music to the iPod (but did allow me to register with Apple and load songs into iTunes) 
  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model which is way too big for what I really need I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity 
Perhaps over time I will fill it up but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used I have a long way to go
 Thats the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB 
The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements but honestly I havent used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane 
The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use 
  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesnt get all scratched up 
(It sure does look nice though)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere the quality of the audio is excellent the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive and the storage capacity and battery life are huge     
 Still my favorite MP3 player	 Is it overpriced 
 Dunno possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here
  Using the software iTunes is relatively simple you just plug the USB cable in wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod
  At first I primarily used it as a stand-alone portable player but it wasnt until I decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that I truly adored this device
 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable it wasnt too hard to do and now I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again
  If there were any complaints I have they are marginal but one is Apples properietary set-up for music files their incompatibility with other music services (ie Napster) is down right wrong
 I mean it would be nice if one day iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path  
 I go everywhere with it on campus in the gym and at work too 
By far the best MP3 player Ive ever used	
 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers
However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires surprise surprise) 
I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and its still working flawlessly
For a sleeker smaller and more average MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful
You can transfer music from one PC to the other
The music MUST be on your computer
Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files 
They were on his iPod but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer and after he tried the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod assuming they were stolen () 
 Also some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files whereas the iPod does NOT 
Considering the fact that just about any CD you purchase and rip to your hard drive will be formatted as a WMA file iTunes version 45 (included with new iPod releases) contains an auto-converter that converts WMA to MP3 for iPod compatability
 My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesnt work on certain files and presents error messages 
So I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3 then downloaded them to the iPod
 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if youre an audiophile this will bother you - frankly I cant tell the difference)  
Also I dont like how when I first set up my iPod it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation it will not configure the iPod and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod hard drive to a new letter
 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use 
In the meantime users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer its impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which were not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours  
 This is really the only downside to the iPod - setting it up and downloading music 
The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent
 The design as mentioned above is sleek cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good but its always hard to tell these days) 
 The battery life lastes 12 hours and charges quickly (As mentioned above the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all) Once youve downloaded your music you can access the tracks by artist genre album composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - eg covers of songs) etc
 I love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but thats how FUN using the iPod actually is
 The  sound quality is great 
The included earphones are pretty good - my advice 
  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute
 As mentioned above accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun
 With the iPod you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when its connected to your PC as an external hard drive 
This is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents
Also included in the games section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs 
The game plays a segment of a song and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others 
  Whats great about this is that its a game based on YOUR music 
When I first saw music trivia quiz I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - its not
 Its a lot of fun and really tests your reflexes 
Its a good way to pass the time
  20 GB OR 40 GB  The pros of the 40 GB Comes with a dock station and double storage space (10000 songs)
 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5000 songs more than youre ever likely to need at any one time
 I mean for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive not the iPod 
Its just my personal advice but youre saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod its very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything
  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and for the price I highly recommend it
 At $290 (the price I paid) its quite a bargain
  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as Im concerned and the best MP3 player on the market 
Whether youre on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music you could definitely do much much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple
 Let me say first that I have always been a hater of all things Apple  
However after holding an ipod at circuit city I knew I had to have one  
 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces
  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the hold switch 
One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware which is great advice
  I have almost dropped the ipod several times just because it is so smooth  
Everything else about the ipod is great the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it
 Organizing music is a breeze too  
 You can put songs in multiple categories which is great
Finding all the albums songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music
 As with most headphones that come with any type of music playerI recommend throwing these into the nearest river unless you like having hard round pieces of plastic in your ears 
 I have the e3cs and man does everything on the ipod sound great   
 You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it
  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this 
 The outlook is a little clunky to use on the ipod but it is functional 
Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY 
 To see a great little short film about this go to ipodsdirtysecretcom    This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries
    If you can get past this little flaw give the ipod 5 stars because everything else about it is pretty much perfect  
However in my mind $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS 
 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently and had the opportunity to play with my cousins 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it
 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer
  Overall I think the iPod is a good player although I would note some features that turned me off 
 LOOKS AND DURABILITY I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface  
  While I like the minimialism of the player I try to avoid plastic products made of white- they tend to yellow with age 
While they have released those tattoos for the players I think those just look cheap and gaudy especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed  
The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousins player was relatively new it was riddled with scratches
  While hes not the most careful guy in the world it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience they look terrible scratched up  
THE CLICKWHEEL Again I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread 
As a student I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me 
 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat 
 BATTERY Compared to the other players on the market the iPod has one of the worst batteries around
 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge respe
 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one Im aware of that has this and its 5 GB) this can be an issue  
IN SUMMARY This is a good basic player  Its not for everyone and if youre in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have and see how they stack up 
 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apples iTunes-only program
  But since a lot of these MP3 players are marketed on aesthetics do go to your local store or borrow a friends and see how the product actually feels and works
  This may be the player for you but its not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player and others are ahead of it in certain areas so practice some caution when you buy     
If you want colour screens photos videos etc buy the latest (extremely expensive) model I think the new 60GB has all the extras 
This 20GB just plays the songs most people wont even use the 20GB space Ive got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB
  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver 
Both from unspecialist makes and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts and has not invested the money that Apple has 
  As far as an actual player is concerned the iPod is next to none
 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s unlike the iPod 
But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player
 Its well worth it the mp3s do in fact sound better  
 The iPod package comes with everything you need the AC adaptor firewire cable (quicker than USB but slower than USB 2 which it also gives) those snazzy and powerfull headphones and of course the player 
I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs get a larger size such as the 40GB just to be on the safe side
 Actually I had two the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out  I didnt tell them I had dropped it once) 
 Then I had the second one in my boyfriends car and his car got jacked  
  The major change from the previous model other than the extra 5G for the same price is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter and the already minimal buttons (menu play/pause forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10000 stolen mp3s 
 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe thats why you never get a decent manual with any of their products) 
 I like the click wheel OK but actually the one problem Ive had with this my third iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets stuck meaning either it wont respond at all or it jumps down playlists uncontrollably 
 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last but I kind of doubt it  
 The thing is naturally youre going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it
The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing you just cant beat that with a stick  
But seriously though how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen
 The other thing is the earbuds  
  These are nice ones and you get great sound at first but again they break if you even think mean things about them 
 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two 
 And Im really not that rough with things 
 These issues aside the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one you cant be without one
  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board
  PC users have a lot of choices but based on what Ive heard and read the iPod really is the best all-around athough being a Mac product it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software
  And if youre a Mac user like me theyve naturally made sure you have no viable alternative  
A lot of the reviews Ive read talk about IPODS in general
 Im writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model
 I ordered the mini from amazon and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store  
  After talking to the salesman I instead bought the 4G 20GB (that stands for 4th generation it looks like a mini - same features) and didnt know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell including on amazon are still 3G
 The player is great 
 I didnt think I would need more than the 5GB that the mini has but once I downloaded a few audio books on top of my CDs -- Im GLAD I have the extra memory
 However the battery life isnt as good as I would like 
There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency butIve never completely run out of juice just dangerously low on long airline trips 
 For about $5 6 dollars you can get an extended warranty and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies
  Think about that if you are worried about battery life 
 Overall this product is AWESOME 
 All the cool features of the mini but with 20GB instead of 5  
 Pros Holds a ton of music 
No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place 
 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great
 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger
 They are EXTREMELY convient and you dont have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes which provides qulity music at low prices
Hard drive screws up occasionally
The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used 
I have a ton of cds and I make a mess trying to organize them into things
 The I-Pod certainly helps me with my music and I can take it anywhere with me
 I can take it to Work School and even listen to it at my computer 
Also a word of warning hide the White Earbud headphones because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you dont take steps to hide it from view of other people 
 held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the click wheel that had previously only been available for the iPod mini 
I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod mini - basically for ease of use and the feel it gives 
   The click wheel is much easier to use compared to the previous generations models with the touch screen 
It takes seconds to work the menus and go from song to song  
Does not come with the dock remote control or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price so you can still end up with the same accessories and a new generation iPod for the same money
Both are EXTREMELY user friendly and take minutes to get used to
   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time 
The first battery charge lasted only about six hours 
That may be due to the fact that I used the menus a lot and had it hooked up to the Griffin iTrip (The iTrip works great) for most of that time
 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours
 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the click sound to get this much life out of it   
I was worried about what the sound quality would be like but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound
 The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen
 It is sharper on the mini units 
This is only a problem at night during the day the screen is very easy to see 
The backlight helps out at night but can be a drain on the battery 
You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely) so its only a minor issue  
 The first time I took it in the car and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles thousands of songs to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience
 Although iPods have been around for a few years they didnt really get hot until now 
I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it 
 The only problem is the battery life
 After about 3-4 months you see your battery draining faster than it should 
After a year your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one 
Apples iPod battery replacement service costs $100 
 You pay $300 for the iPod itself then $100 to get the battery fixed 
If you look on Google or around the webs many search engines you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price 
Apple needs to step it up and get better longer lasting batteries     
Not perfect but Im still enamored	 Ive had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now and its really great for listening to the radio 
 I am so in love with this thing I can hardly stand it   
 Its got LOTS of pros and a couple minor cons which I will outline below  
Its still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology youre getting so dont let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover 
The arm band is fantastic and it doesnt budge even at the gym  
I love the slim design the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky  
The ear buds that come with it look cheap but the sound quality is amazing 
A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down  )  I love the shuffle function which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all
  I use mine mostly at the gym so this is fantastic for me
  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time  
I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off 
 I am a big fan of iTunes simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site  
However I have found that converting my CDs and MP3s into the iTunes library for upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time
  Its the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons without a doubt
  Of course once the songs are converted you dont have to worry with them again
 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist it just mixes up the titles) 
 I have no clue why this happens as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads 
 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle)
Sales of Apples mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years 
Thats a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful influential and trendy product
Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated because do I rate my personal connotation on it 
Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products 
 However having said that this could just be because I havent really had enough time to experience it in its entirety
