does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video  
or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white  
before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support  or run the player over with your car  try these simple troubleshooting ideas first  
no picture  
hopefully you still have the remote control  
using the remote control  press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote  
the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive  
if this doesnt bring back the picture  try pressing this button without playing a dvd  
if you dont get video back  now you can run the player over with your car  
picture scrolling in b/w  
you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard  
press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote  
the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc  
by pressing p/n  you should be able to get a good picture on the screen

i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips  
i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal  
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button  
the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  
but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  
i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  
for the price it is a well spent investment  
i ve owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998  
it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  
it plays alternate video formats ( vcds  svcds  cvds ) very well  
and amazoncom has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong  
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e  mp3s )  
that s a rare and valuable feature  
i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 07 gb at a time ( cd-r )  
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  
i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo  
weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x  3x  4x  1/2x  etc ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ]  
if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price  i highly recommend this model  
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player  
i spoke to a rep at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months  
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd s such as alias season 1 and season 2  
for the money  get a better quality player  
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd s to play  
i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse  
will never purchase apex again  
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  
pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas  
for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  
i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  
there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  
i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  
apex does nt answer the phone  
very bad quality  
i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  
i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  
have used it frequently and have had no problems  
i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  
great quality picture and features  
i ve bought 3 apex dvd players now  
they play just about everything  but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them  
nice machines  but i consider their quality pretty low now  
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas  
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept  
i am still trying to resolve it four months later  
it looks great - and is loaded with features  
have had problems since the first day 
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  
save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month  
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  
i bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  
it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   
this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  
the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  
( he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them  ) 
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting  
the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  
i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  
the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  
having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  
i have not used the progressive scan feature  
this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  
while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  
any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support  
while i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it  
i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires  
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do  
i changed video cables  tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help  
i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd s  after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it s job  
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked  
as i emailed to the the customer service department  the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning  
do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality  or at least works  
i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems  
wo nt play a lot of discs  
some movies it played yesterday  it wo nt play today  
it wo nt play 80 % of my movies  which are all store boughten  
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent  
amazon  do your customers a big favor  do nt carry this item  and give them refunds  
there should have been a recall on this product  
i repeat - do nt wast your money  
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work  
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working  
amazon has been working with me to refund my money  but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return  
i have had great experience with amazon  but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems  
the dvd player does not work properly  
the player usually plays dvd s  but has occasional problems such as  1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd  
this has happened with several different dvd s and occasionally if we keep trying something  it will work when it did not work one time before  
after we discovered the problems  we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months )  but we never got in touch with themthe customer support telephone number is always busy  and they do not answer their web customer support  
i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now  
nothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  
i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  
luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything  
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband  
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  
we did nt get to use it again for over a month ( sad  i know )  
but when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  
we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  
though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days )  i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  
they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  
i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  
do not buy this player  
we ve purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work  apex  dvd players and none worked  
called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player )  
( on here of course ) also  a couple dvd s would nt play and they were new ones  
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective  
it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced  
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line  
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again  
door broke after a month  
unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs  
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything  
it s money down the drain  
after @ 3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  
only used for 3 month before it s down  
i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it  
it sends discoutinous signals to tv  so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment  
the other thing i do nt like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated  
maybe it s good for tvs with not so good color settings  but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures  
i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon  
as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box  i questioned my judgement  
the entire unit was poorly crafted  
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board  
after hooking the thing up  i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it  
most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition  
the dvd player just wouldt recognize them  
it would spin  read  spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc  
i ended up sending the unit back to amazon  
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  
now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  
features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names  
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed  
i have been trying for over a week to contact apex  
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy  
i accually did nt buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but  the reviews i found here helped me purchase it  
i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck  
because of it s hidden features ( no macrovision  non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd s  
however  the ad-2600 does nt have this feature ( for now )  
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd - / + r s  
it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  
i find this to be a great feature  
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  
for the money apex machines have good features  
you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  
i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy  
i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax  
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows  no disc   
this is the second apex dvd player i ve had - and the last  
my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it  
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing  
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal  
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared  
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy  
well worth the money  
after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player  i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected  
( good going  amazon ) 
i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  
so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvd-r s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  
i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  
the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies  when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray  
so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  
i can t speak to its long-term reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  
but  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  
bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player  
comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included  must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs  
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  
i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago  
one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  
friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  
i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  
consider it for a future gift too  
this dvd play is basicly junk  
it wo nt play all of my movies  
keeps coming up with no disk errors  
i tried called apex cust service  no help  
do nt waste your money  
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash  where it belongs  
this is the 4 apex player that i have bought  
you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more  
each of the 4 lasted less than six months  
you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere  
spend the money its well worth it  
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  
i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  
for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc 
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  
80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic  
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message )  
they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem  
i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i m stuck with a new dvd player that wo nt play my kids disney movies  
i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc s dvd-rom player  
well  this apex dvd player turned out great  
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old $ 200 sharp player  
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds  
it s almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player  
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player  
what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player  
i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  
hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  
one bad thing though  i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  
finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me  
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts  and both were bad  
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out  
amazoncom promptly refunded my money for the first one  because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazoncom  
i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one  
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line  but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy  
i will never buy another apex digital product  
for the most part this is a good dvd player  
but about 25 % of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working  
it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs  
there was neither picture nor sound  
connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer  there was sound but still no picture  
i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem  press i/p button on the remote control  
it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode  
obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode  
we are overall pleased with product  
i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan  
i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03  
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was nt the only one this happened to  ) 
i tried calling the support number for a week  several times a day  and always got a busy signal  
i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can t possibly be more than one  
neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i ve been waiting 27 days  ) 
i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info  
let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv s  not dvd players )  
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time  otherwise i would get a no disc screen  
i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back  
amazon was supposed to send me another one  but did nt and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i m guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ) 
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well )  
seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise )  
also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these )  
output through component connections looks very good  on my non-hd tv  
i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 )  
it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  
for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter / play button  
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  
also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv ) 
ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know  
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  
lot s of other features that i need to find out about  
this thing plays everything i feed it  
i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc s that i had made myself  
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  
i bought this dvd player in november  
i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today  
i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one  
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd s are dirty  
i ve tried several dvd s and even new ones do the same thing  
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc  
i ve tried someone elses and the same thing happens  
i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable  
i just want to at least try an exchange but you can t get through to their number  it s always busy  
do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money  
i bought this as a gift for my sister  
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs  using a multitude of connection methods  and i still can t get a video signal from the machine  
purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it  
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button  
the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever  
i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fineat least until this problem arises again  
i ve registered this unit at wwwapexdigialinccom and listed the problem  
they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it s been 2 weeks without a reply  
i ve called the service number and if it s not busy  it rings forever then eventually dumps you  
once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message  
i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb  
i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife  
3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze  
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk  
have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigitalcom )  but the e-mail address is not valid  
have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo )  but can t get through  
this product sucks  the customer service from apex sucks  
i bought this product from amazon  
after using it for just a month  i could not play any dvd  
i can only hear the sound but no picture  
no contact phone number  only eamil contact which did not respond me  
i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price  
one of the dvd s i received as a christmas present kept freezing  
some dvd s i rented would not play  
now  i suddenly have no picture  
when the player was working it was great but  
the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated  
i used it lightly  and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day  and now it only plays dvds ) 
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  
anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  
with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest  
first of all  i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed  
unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  
as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  
for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  
this player seems to work fine with everything else  
so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  
because of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product  
i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years  
had no problem with it  
now  i thought it s time to upgrade  
so  i bought apex ad-2600 in november  03 from amazon  
it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  
i have a dvd burner  
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw )  
i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  
if you are skeptical about trying apex  
i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years  
i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  
worked for two weeks  
after two weeks the picture kept freezing  
spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player  
apex sucks  
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed  
i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house  
it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  
basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  
so far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  
the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  
the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  
i simply watched the extra features on another player  
had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  
as it is  i m keeping the machine  
but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  
i m giving this player cautious recommendation  
be advised  however  that you may encounter problems  
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  
so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  
prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  
i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas  
video output stopped workin  
this was an awesome player  before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks )  
i might have gotten a lemon  but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine  
i am returning it  and again in the market for a multiformat dvd  svcd  vcd  mp3  etc player  
i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas  
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue )  
but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  
i m editing my review  because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend  
the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem  
great feature list  poor reliability  
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections  and with no v-hold  
thankfully amazon has free return shipping  
retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  
i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents  
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg  kodak pic s and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up   
( i guess only time will tell  ) 
ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error  
what the hell is wrong with this thing  
i bought this thing because it plays everything  
this is the third apex dvd i bought  
the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision  
the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties  
but heck it plays my alias dvds  
it suppose to play everything  
by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet  
i m sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay  
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds 
well  within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic )  
so now it still plays everything  you just can t see it  
we ordered two apex ad-2600 s for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd s - well  
it seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  
update  january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product  
the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  
after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   
after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  
only one disk played through to completion successfully  
i d recommend against this unit  
i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts  
when we tried to hook up the first one  it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door  
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house  that one didn  t work either  
imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex  
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on  
what can i say  i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever  quality design  stable  plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies  
in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220  
the ad-1600 did nt work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up  
my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003  
i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again  as i do like them  
amazon is awaesome  
for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  
recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony  
i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player  
i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly  
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  
i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine  
even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal  
bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price  $ 4999 - $ 10 rebate = $ 3999  
we tried the  finding nemo  dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28  the frames started to freeze for no reason  
cleaned the dvd  tried again  no luck  
i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba  hooked it back-up and the  finding nemo  dvd works fine  
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it s pretty good  
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon  
i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase  until last night  
i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc  
the player kept displaying  no disc   so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # *  
i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc  
the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another  
the other company is currently  out of stock  so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today  
hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine  
if not i will avoid apex products in the future  
besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  
it plays everything  even vcd s  
if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  
if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating  
i will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  
somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  
small problem  
you have to ask yourself   how much money is dissapointment worth   
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells   dad  somethings wrong with the dvd player  come quick   
3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken  
4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow  trying to figure it out was really something  
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control  
you will be told goldstar codes work  and you will be told zenith codes will work  and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work  
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600  
if this is your fist dvd player  
bought two ad2600 s for christmas  
one still works fine  the other quit after one day  
apex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone  
the dvd player is fine  
to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  
if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   
little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40 $  
i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that s a few years old  
of course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  
the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait  
but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there  
i bought this for my dad for christmas  
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine  but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture  
let s face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture  
had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine  
save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation  
seemed like a good deal  but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes   no disc   
granted  i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas  but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player  
first  the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds  
when i hit  menu  it told me   playback only   
i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu  
in addition  it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player  although that may have been just the batteries that came with it  
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  
i think for about $ 40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though  
i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it  both here and in other places  
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment  for myself and for my parents  for whom it was a gift  
it played only one out of three dvd s without problems  the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches  
both of the problem dvd s would repeatedly freeze during playback  while the counter on the player kept going  
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu  
these problems were consistent  and also not present on another dvd player  
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed  
there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  
all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift  
i was impressed by this very inexpensive playerfor the first three hours  and then it died  
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev machine did it automatically )  and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  
still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  
so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch  
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  
i try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  
my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  
i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see  
the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  
i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  
guess where this unit is headed  
i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player  
unfortunately  the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way  
i called apex s support number numerous times but it just kept ringing  
i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different  more trusted brand of dvd player  
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  
price 
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd  vcd  dvd-r  audio cd and it played all 
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 
remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  
if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine  
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc  
it will read and play all cd audio disc  
guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one  
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far  
i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected  
i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck  
however  it has failed to deliver on quality  
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies  
on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside  
after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common  
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product  
i am returning mine for a replacement  but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund  but never buy another apex product in the future  
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display  
picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured  yet false silver plate  
i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this  
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs  
however  it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips  
i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats  but others say they can  
also  it was only $ 3999 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player  
good quality video  
bought this player after reading the reviews here which identify it as reading most formats including dvd + rw s and vcd s  
can t say whether i rec d an  updated  model but it will not read dvd + rw s or vcd s for me  
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine  
i do nt have a dvd + r to try 
mixed bag i guess but the price was right  
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price  
it goes nicely with my apex 27  in my bedroom  
the build quality feels solid  it does nt shake or whine while playing discs  and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd51 sound good )  
i paid twenty dollars more than the current price  and even then it was a steal  
think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player  
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did  
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems  
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture  zoom etc  
so sit back  relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can  and for a fraction of the price  
only problem  if you think it s going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims  do nt hold your breath  
otherwise it ll get there the day you get back from the hospital  
if you watch dvds once in a while like i do  get this  
apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there  
if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours  
however  i do nt know the dvd s performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing  
either way  can t go wrong with this price  
i am really impressed by this dvd player  
if it can fit in the drive bay  this dvd player will play it  
for instance  i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds
