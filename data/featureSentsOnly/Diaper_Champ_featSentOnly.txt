So far (3 weeks) weve had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all
We hated that thing
And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used
We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it
My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor
My daughter is now 2 and 1/2 and I am still enjoying this product
We purchased it based on the reviews and it really lived up to our expectations
1 It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills
I dont know how this product would hold up to either of these situations
The container is hard to open which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toystoo) I dont consider these difficulties but features for the older baby
We graduated to real underwear last week in our house and Im passing this on instead of retiring it- its too good to sit unused in the basement or dump
Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage
This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms
The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags
The Diaper Genie needs its own refill bags in order to work and thats just more money that you dont have to spend
I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and cant tightly bundle it without a mess the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail
The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and theyre on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are
I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesnt start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and thats many many months down the road
We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child
I have noticed an odor (one the I expected) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you dont smell anything every time you use it
I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it
Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so
For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it
I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasnt often but I can see how it would happen
And best of all no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags
But from my experience by the time it gets to that point the bag is really heavy so I think this is kind of helpful- its a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying
This is a really great buy for yourself or as a shower gift
Its certainly not worth the money or the upkeep
I love this product
We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it
We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did
*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers
The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into what diaper smell in less time than that
The champ the baby bjorn fluerville diaper bag and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase
Great product easy to use economical effective absolutly fabulous
I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler but Ive got 2 years to worry about that and Im sure Ill figure out preventative measures like any other mom
4 months later
First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor
Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn it is fine
Every time
Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart
For diaper disposal you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open
You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ
This will never be a problem with the Champ
3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months
The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use
My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did
I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag
We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie but Im not 100% sure
We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used
We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped
It holds almost a weeks worth of diapers and you dont need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work
At first I had a problem with some smell then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all
I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time it is that simple
Only problem
it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full
I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got however I was not impressed
For one thing The diapers always get jammed in it
The product also leaves a faint smell in the room  
All in all the Diaper Champ serves its purpose but it does not live up to its good reviews
I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags
The reviews were definitely right
We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it
It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South where odors of all kinds are generally rife)
For the first 9 months or so we only needed to empty this once a week
Now that our sons diapers are a little larger they take up more space and we empty twice a week
We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper)
It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound) but now that our son is walking and exploring I consider this a positive attribute
Update (March 2005) My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use no problems with odors and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby -)
In fact people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old sons diaper have been amazed at how the very potent smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ
For those who are experiencing odor problems here are some suggestions which should solve the problem  
I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week
Also for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isnt as effective as time passes keep the following in mind AS BABIES GET OLDER THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS
All in all this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price
I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it and that helps but when its hot out- well just be prepared
 We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home until about 13 months  
That seemed to work -- for about 3 days  
My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
I wanted this product because i didnt have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended
The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment
This is a GREAT product
Not only can they be a pain to install but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of
I couldnt picture myself yelling to hubby Honey I know you have sixty other things to getcan you also pick up refills for the diaper pail  
Excellent diaper disposal unit
I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented)
I am soooo pleased with this product
Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it
Gets stinky after a few months the seal on the piston doesnt seal anymore
You will be sorry after a few months     
Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years you get somewhat immune to it
Let me just say this After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all 
We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month 
We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems
Dont listen to the bad reviews
In fact I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old that I bought one for our new babys room
Wow - was that disappointing and we didnt even have it 6 months before it broke
5  The price is right
