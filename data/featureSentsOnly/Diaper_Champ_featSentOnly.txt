Works great no odor and uses regular bags
So far (3 weeks) weve had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all
It contains the smell from our babys diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside
I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it
I dont know if well run into trouble down the road with odors but so far I have no complaints and Im very happy not to have to buy those refills
We hated that thing
The bags never fit right and then it never spun right
And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used
As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes
There are no specail bags to deal with or buy
We use the cheap $199 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around
Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone
Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will
We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it
It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and its fairly inexpensive as baby products go
In concept its a fabulous idea
I love that you dont have to purchase expensive refills
I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ
The cons at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth
My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor
Im concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse
If I had to do it over again even with the cost savings of using any type of bag I would go w/ the Diaper Genie
its easier and much more convenient to use because it doesnt have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills
There is no odor and extremely easy to use
Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys
My daughter is now 2 and 1/2 and I am still enjoying this product
We purchased it based on the reviews and it really lived up to our expectations
1 It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills
2 You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though youve wasted plastic
Heres the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula which is what gives baby waste a foul smell and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them
I dont know how this product would hold up to either of these situations
The container is hard to open which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toystoo) I dont consider these difficulties but features for the older baby
We graduated to real underwear last week in our house and Im passing this on instead of retiring it- its too good to sit unused in the basement or dump
Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast
It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless
Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage
This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms
The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags
ANY Garbage bags will fit
The Diaper Genie needs its own refill bags in order to work and thats just more money that you dont have to spend
This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers
I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and cant tightly bundle it without a mess the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail
My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesnt even fit a smaller sized garbage bag
The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and theyre on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are
I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesnt start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and thats many many months down the road
This pail doesnt really keep in odors anymore and well probably have to get a new one but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie
We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child
It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie plus why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store
It also holds a lot more diapers
Any diaper pail if you leave it for long enough is going to smell
I have noticed an odor (one the I expected) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you dont smell anything every time you use it
For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky
My second child I didnt get any
Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out
I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont have to pay out the nose for replacements
Its also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers
My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didnt want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie
Well I suppose this is better than an open pail but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use
The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle
Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ
But sometimes if the Champ is too full the flip handle wont function
(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell  Even though not particularly aesthetic how about making the Champ clear and see-through) So I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper which I must remove usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full
A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if youre in a place where you dont want to dump a dirty diaper like in your friends wastebasket or kitchen garbage
Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ
Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed
I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it
I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie
The diaper champ couldnt be easier to use
And the biggest plus is that you dont have to buy any expensive refills
It takes regular trash bags
I generally put kitchen size bags in it but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch
And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained which the diaper genie never did
If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained than the diaper champ is the one for you
Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so
it wasnt much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash
THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great
For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it
I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasnt often but I can see how it would happen
Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail
It holds a lot of diapers not to mention the odor
Its easy to use (just a flip of the lid and the diaper is gone)
Just unlock the top and remove the plastic bag
And best of all no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags
Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers this is the truly the only diaper pail to get
My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers
As a first-time mom I got the great idea that cloth would be better and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers
She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers pay the extra $ and go for Kushies theyre beautifully made and work very well from what Ive heard)
Even though I never ventured into the cloth land I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life
Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it
Being a very economical person I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills
If you have a really sensitive nose I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ once you have to open it to empty out the full bag youre quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor and scented bags help with that
As one other reviewer pointed out it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the plunger to get the diapers in the pail even though upon inspection the bag doesnt really look full
But from my experience by the time it gets to that point the bag is really heavy so I think this is kind of helpful- its a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying
I love this product
With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones
Plus the fact that it used regular trash bags is great
No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require
We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it
We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did
Heres what we love about this pail
*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers
(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap
*holds the odor in nicely
(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail but that is rare--and it usually just means that weve crammed too much in there and need to change the bag
We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughters nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers
It holds quite a few diapers and pops them in quickly and easily
I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special diaper trash bags necessary
The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into what diaper smell in less time than that
The champ the baby bjorn fluerville diaper bag and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase
Great product easy to use economical effective absolutly fabulous
Update I knew that I loved the champ and useing the diaper genie at a friends house REALLY reinforced that
There is no comparison the chanp is easy and smell free the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isnt any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ
I love this pail
No smell easy to use with one hand free and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you dont get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find
I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler but Ive got 2 years to worry about that and Im sure Ill figure out preventative measures like any other mom
4 months later
Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE
Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesnt really contain the smell
It definitely keeps the smell out
But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner
First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor
But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ) which can trap the odor better
Every time
The diaper champ is the best
Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart
One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper
You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot
For diaper disposal you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open
With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid
It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers
The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag
2) The Champ uses regular store bags
You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ
You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ
Special bags are expensive hard to find and you never have enough
This will never be a problem with the Champ
3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months
The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year
I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers
If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers
The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use
Regardless to this fact I believe the Champ is the best way to go
There probably isnt a pail out on the market that doesnt get smelly after a while
My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did
dirty diapes and soaked diapers
I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag
I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty
even did while daughter sleep and no noise
I use the scented bags and even if I dont no smell
We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie but Im not 100% sure
We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used
We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only
We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped
This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in
But like I stated its better then a trash can but Im not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie
It holds almost a weeks worth of diapers and you dont need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work
At first I had a problem with some smell then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all
I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly but that is not a big deal
The latch isnt terribly difficult and I wouldnt want it to be too easy since it sits in my sons room
She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well
It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode
It doesnt stink ever (like some have assumed since it doesnt wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon)
I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time it is that simple
Id abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in
This is a great diaper pail
There is no odor and it is very easy to use
(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby) Also we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie)
And its the largest diaper pail Ive seen without taking up more floor space
Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop) it is easier to use and clean and has a larger capacity
Only problem
it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full
I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got however I was not impressed
For one thing The diapers always get jammed in it
The product also leaves a faint smell in the room  
All in all the Diaper Champ serves its purpose but it does not live up to its good reviews
I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags
I cant smell anything (and believe me this is quite something with my baby)
Its much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan
The reviews were definitely right
We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it
It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South where odors of all kinds are generally rife)
It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags easy to clean and most important easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle
As the bag fills you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag
For the first 9 months or so we only needed to empty this once a week
Now that our sons diapers are a little larger they take up more space and we empty twice a week
We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper)
It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound) but now that our son is walking and exploring I consider this a positive attribute
Update (March 2005) My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use no problems with odors and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby -)
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail 
I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie because I didnt like the idea of having to buy special bags
No one has ever come to my house and noticed diaper odor
In fact people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old sons diaper have been amazed at how the very potent smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ
For those who are experiencing odor problems here are some suggestions which should solve the problem  
I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week
For those who complain that the pail gets stuck that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL 
Also making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well
Hello it does house dirty diapers 
Also for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isnt as effective as time passes keep the following in mind AS BABIES GET OLDER THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS
Again this is because as their diet changes so does the consistency and odor of their stool in other words it gets stinkier  
All in all this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price
I love the diaper champ it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesnt cost an arm and a leg for refills
The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full
I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it and that helps but when its hot out- well just be prepared
 We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home until about 13 months  
Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not
Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient
Its stable so a curious toddler cant easily tip it over
CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor
Also diapers tend to stay in the middle causing the pail to get backed up
My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
 (Being a diaper pail Id prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary)     
I wanted this product because i didnt have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended
The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment
I cant tell you how many times ive chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it
This is a GREAT product
I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills
Not only can they be a pain to install but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of
I mean with babies its already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula 
I couldnt picture myself yelling to hubby Honey I know you have sixty other things to getcan you also pick up refills for the diaper pail  
We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags
Weve never experienced odor from the pail
It was easy to assemble and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion
I also love that you can flip the device with one hand
Makes life easier and keeps babys room smelling like baby not dirty diapers
Excellent diaper disposal unit
I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented)
I am soooo pleased with this product
But just to let you know that Ive been breastfeeding and the poop doesnt stink as much as formula poop  
So I cant tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell but its excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby
Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it
It works easily with one hand which is important
Also it takes any kitchen sized trash bag so there is no special bag to stock
While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets
Gets stinky after a few months the seal on the piston doesnt seal anymore
Also diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston
Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly 
I gave up and got a diaper Dekor
Much more hands off and takes any size diapers
Dont buy the diaper champ
You will be sorry after a few months     
Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years you get somewhat immune to it
I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point but this prduct seems to work very well so far
Let me just say this After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all 
Well the Champ has survived its first year with our son and it is great
We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month 
The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome
We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $600 and they work great
We just recently had to buy another roll of bags SO $600 for a year of bags- cant beat that
We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems
Dont listen to the bad reviews
This is really a nice diaper pail
In fact I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old that I bought one for our new babys room
Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie  
Wow - was that disappointing and we didnt even have it 6 months before it broke
1  The Diaper Champ doesnt require special refills that are expensive and hard to find
We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully
We dont have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail
2  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table
With them you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail  
The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle
He thinks it is magic when the diaper disappears  
Pop the lid fold it back on its hinge pull the trash bag through the ring and take out the dirty diapers  
To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring fold it over the sides of the ring and close  
It keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room
Yes you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle but then it is gone
Remember it does hold dirty diapers  
To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid
Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead
At $30 we put one in the nursery and one in our toddlers room
