there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  
just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted  
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile  
i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75  far superior to at &#38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  
i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  
my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of re-entering my numbers  
the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal  price  service ) is a winner  i highly recommend it  
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint  
after years with that carrier s expensive plans and horrible customer service  portability seemed heaven-sent  
it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- ie organizer )  and the radio  
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14  i believe )  though the reception is unpredictable  
also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  
the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds / screensavers  but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there )  
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  
the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  
the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for ( yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road  )  
forget talking on it in public -- you just can t hear the other person  
since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work  in 24 hours   
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when t-zones never worked  
24 hours  
by what time standards -- martian  
apparently  t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can t keep up with demands  
also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service ( duh )  so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out  
i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( ie me  
i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile  
recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine  
disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine  i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone  
two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order  
i ve had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola  sony ericsson  nokia etc ) and in my opinion  nokia has the best menus and promps hands down  
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  
i have had this phone for about 5 months  
at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  
it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  
i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  
vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  
it has a nice color screen  
nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use  
i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back  
when i got it home  i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there  
so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support  only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem  
so i had to give up and return it  having lost about 4 hours  
while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  
negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  
the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone  
only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  
one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile  
i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  
if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  
it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  
this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  
the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  
i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go  
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  
great features   
buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem  
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  
the reception and sound quality are top-notch  
the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  
the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  
which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  
- excellent sound quality 
- bright  visible screen 
- some features in the user interface 
i am very pleased with its quality and durability  
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  
most of our emplyees use this model phone  
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  
this phone is very user-friendly  easy to manipulate &#38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  
the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  
color screen is good  
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  
navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  
battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  
sound quality  
the most important thing for me is sound quality  
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  
i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  
as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  
how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  
the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key )  
that is a very nice feature  
the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  
the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life )  
features  
the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  
the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65000 colors )  and i can t say much about the motorolla  
in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  
both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  
i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend  
you can do * so * much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games  
the phone s sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing  
the features are really cool like the radio  
why i do nt can this product without a plan  
i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  
this really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  
i waited a few years between phones  mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one  
the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  
nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38 options  but comparing to my older motorola phone  it gets a failing grade in speaker quality  
i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 )  mainly because of my sister and the features  
it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  
on an average  you would charge it once a week  
i simply love this feature  
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth )  
the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  
the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  
i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  
i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  
after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks  i searched for a smaller alternative  
i have used this phone for two months now  
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small  not too large )  it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want  
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control  
nokia does not disappoint in this model  
one complaint  the screen is too easily scratched  
i got this phone in t-mobile s current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal  
this is almost it but not quite but the price was right  
oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  
great features   
i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38 t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years  
i went to an at &#38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  
with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  
i have had no problems with the phone  
one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  
people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant  
service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great  
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones  
1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone  
yes  the features are numerous  
the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line  
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before  
the radio feature has superb sound quality  
even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them  
one thing that i found out recently is that you do nt need t-zones from tmobile to go online  
the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering  
that beside you are prob very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for  and one that has not yet been mentioned  using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 10 port  
using the gprs option you can pay 1999 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account  
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all  
the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia  
but anyway  the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing  
great screen and great sound  
the voice quality is very good  and it gets great reception ( that is  in places where you get t-mobile coverage  which is not that good  see below )  
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright  and commands are very responsive  
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons  
this model does have the traditional key arrangement  it s just that they are really close to one another  and have unconventional shapes  so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands  
( to be fair  the same can be said about many korean imports  and the nokia s build quality is light years ahead of the koreans  ) 
the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all  unless dialing a number  
unfortunately  the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone  but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming  
when i turned the phone on  the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is  
this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music  
the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries  with multiple phone number per entry  so you can program your boss s home  work and cellphone numbers all under one contact  
you can get weather  movies  horoscopes and more with a few clicks  
every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone  
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved  
with all its complicated features  the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great  
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile s services  because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network  
after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another  i got fed up and have decided to return the phone  
bottom line  if you re attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad  forget it  
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it  
i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then   
i did nt had any problem till now  
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution  
however  the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality  
i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about
